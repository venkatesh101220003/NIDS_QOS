Overview
This project focuses on the development of a novel Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDPS) that addresses the challenges of detecting and preventing high-speed, malicious network traffic in modern environments. The system's innovative architecture leverages QoS configurations and parallel processing techniques to enhance security, ensure efficient traffic management, and optimize packet analysis. By combining advanced technologies and a performance-driven design, the project provides a reliable and scalable solution to meet the increasing demands of secure network management.

Objective
The goal of this project is to create an NIDPS capable of processing traffic speeds up to 8Gbps with zero packet loss while maintaining high detection accuracy (over 99%). The solution is designed to improve security, reduce inefficiencies in packet handling, and enhance overall network reliability.
